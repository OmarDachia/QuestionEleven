About Fahrenheit and Celsius
The Fahrenheit temperature scale is named for German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit and is the temperature measurement commonly used by the United States (and its associated territories) and several Caribbean nations. On the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F (at sea level).

The Celsius temperature scale—originally called centigrade and later renamed for Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius—is used almost everywhere else in the world. On the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water is 0°C, and the boiling point of water is 100°C (at sea level).

1. Celsius to Fahrenheit
Celsius to Fahrenheit is the conversion of temperature from Celsius unit to Fahrenheit unit. Temperature scales provide a way of measuring how hot or cold a body is. Fahrenheit and celsius are temperature scales. The Celsius scale was invented by Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, in 1742 and the Fahrenheit scale was invented by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, a German physicist, in 1724. The symbol used for Fahrenheit is °F whereas for Celsius it's °C.

Water freezes at 32° Fahrenheit and boils at 212° Fahrenheit on a Fahrenheit scale whereas, on Celsius or centigrade scale, water freezes at 0° Celsius and boils at 100° Celsius. i.e., the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales have different reference points and thus, learning the C to F formula for conversion of Celsius to Fahrenheit is important.
Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using the 
°F = (°C x 1.8) + 32 or
°F = °C x (9/5) + 32 formula.

2. Celsius to Fahrenheit Formula
Celsius to Fahrenheit formula is the conversion formula to convert the given temperature from °C to temperature in °F. We know that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees on the Celsius scale and 32 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale, whereas the boiling point of water is 100 degrees on a Celsius scale and 212 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale.
Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with the 
°C = (°F - 32) x (5/9) formula.

How to Convert Celsius into Fahrenheit?
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, we will be using the same C to F formula given above. C to F conversion formula for a given value can be expressed as,

°F = °C × (9/5) + 32

Where,

C = Measure of temperature in degree celsius/centigrade (°C).
F = Measure of temperature in degree Fahrenheit (°F).
To convert degree Celsius to Fahrenheit, we can follow the steps given below:

Step 1: Identify the temperature value in Celsius.
Step 2: Multiply the given temperature by 9.
Step 3: Divide the product by 5.
Step 4: Add 32 to thae result of Step 3. That will be the required value in degree Fahrenheit (°F).
